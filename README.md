## Key Concepts

### What is DevOps?
DevOps is a **culture** that improves an organization's ability to deliver applications quickly and efficiently. It focuses on:
- **Automation**: Reducing manual tasks.
- **Quality**: Ensuring high-quality deliverables.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of applications.
- **Testing**: Continuous testing to ensure reliability.

### Why DevOps?
DevOps emerged to address inefficiencies in traditional software delivery processes. By automating tasks and improving collaboration between teams, DevOps enables faster and more reliable delivery of applications.

### Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **Virtual Machines** are logical partitions of physical servers.
- They allow multiple teams to use the same physical server efficiently.
- **Hypervisors** (e.g., VMware, Xen) are software that create and manage VMs.
- Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud use virtualization to provide scalable resources.
